## Plans

Basic plan is to finish this guide until all formulas, indecators
are accurate on calculations, design Strategy class to have a posibility
to test strategies are working. Maybe create a package for all these 
functionalities, AI with SciSharp, pack indicators and formulas to a 
package which depends on how many people will interest in this project
